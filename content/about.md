About
==========================

This website is built up using the following tools:

- __Pico__

    This is a Content Management System, or CMS. It allows the user to
    create a website without needing to (have the knowledge to) code
    the webpage. Other popular CMS are WordPress and Grav. Pico uses
    __Markdown__ (see link in footer for a guide) in order to write the content
    on the webpage. Pico is a
    small and fast CMS using simple text files to store the content instead
    of using a database for this purpose.

- __SASS__ (see link in footer for a guide)

    SASS is a CSS preprocessor which is used to better organize
    code and be able to use more advanced features than CSS itself
    can offer. For example using variables and functions. It is also
    possible to easily implement modules, such as on this webpage
    where the modules Normalize and Font Awesome are used

- __Package manager__ Composer and NPM for handling PHP and javascript packages
 used on this website.

- __Git and Github__ (see link in footer)
    Git is used to track changes in source code, ie to keep
    version control of the website. Github is a hosting service that is used
    to manage the Git repositories.
